I'm Riccardo Antonelli (rantonels), a physics student currently living in Padua, Italy. I have acquired my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Padua, under a scholarship at the [Scuola Galileiana](http://www.unipd-scuolagalileiana.it/en/). Later this year I will enroll in a Ph.D. program. My research interests relate to string theory, holography, and quantum gravity.

You can take a look at my [M.Sc. thesis "Holographic effective field theories: a case study" here](https://github.com/rantonels/tesi-magistrale/raw/master/tesi.pdf).
