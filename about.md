I'm Riccardo Antonelli (rantonels), a physics student currently living in Pisa, Italy. I have acquired my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Padua, under a scholarship at the [Scuola Galileiana](http://www.unipd-scuolagalileiana.it/en/). Currently I am a Ph.D. student at the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/). My research interests relate to string theory, holography, and quantum gravity.

You can take a look at my [M.Sc. thesis "Holographic effective field theories: a case study" here](https://github.com/rantonels/tesi-magistrale/raw/master/tesi.pdf).

**Hologrammata** is a little repository of anything in theoretical physics that I find too fascinating not to talk about.
