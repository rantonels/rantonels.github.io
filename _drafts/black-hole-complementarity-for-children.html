<p>In general relativity, black holes act as literal sinkholes of information. A black hole is nothing else than a region of spacetime (interior) cut off completely from the rest of it (exterior) by an imaginary (for now) membrane called the event horizon, such that if you are in the interior, you can never cross the horizon to get back out into the exterior. That's more or less the actual definition, and all we are interested in for now. So if an object carrying information is dropped into a black hole, it cannot be recovered. From the outside perspective, the information is not accessible anymore.</p>
<p>That is somewhat unsettling. If you insist that information be actually conserved, it should then be stored into the black hole itself, someway, but no non-suicidal measurement could acquire it. In classical mechanics, and we are in the classical regime, you would expect to be possible in principle to measure perfectly the state of the whole Universe and to use time-evolution to predict its state at any previous or future time, Ã  la Laplace's demon. But if a black hole withholds (or worse, destroys) information about things that have fallen in, then how can that be reversed? How can you tell what is has to spit out as time runs backwards?</p>
<p>Imagine the usual way in which you would destroy sensitive information, for example a text written on a piece of paper. You light a corner of the sheet of paper, it gladly burns turning into light and ash. The message is unreadable now. The information, however, is not really destroyed: it is encoded in the state of the ash and the light, but irreparably scrambled. What is reduced is <strong>your</strong> information about the state of the system: you look at the ashes and say "well, that's a mound of ashes" and that's your description of the macrostate, a thermodynamic description in terms of a few variables. In reality there is a huge number of possible <em>micro</em>states of all the particles in the mound of ash, and if you <em>knew</em> the actual current microstate, you could evolve the equations of motion back in time to reconstruct the message. So this is what one means by conservation of information. Instead your imprecise knowledge of the system in terms of macroscopic observables ("it's a rectangular piece of paper, it has the words SECRET MESSAGE written in a sans-serif black font...") can get less precise as time moves on, and that's simply the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Now, for the black hole. You throw your secret message into the black hole. Let us assume the paper has mass m, and carries no angular momentum nor charge. At the end of it, the black hole has mass M+m and the same charge and angular momentum as before. But then, it is not distinguishable from a black hole in which you threw a <em>blank</em> piece of paper of mass m.&nbsp; That is the main point of the so called no-hair theorem in classical general relativity: two black holes with the same macroscopic parameters (M, J, Q) are actually identical, also microscopically equal. When burning the two sheets of paper, you would get two macroscopically identical-looking mounds of ash, but there is a microstate from which you could reconstruct the information and distinguish them. In the black hole case the information is lost: general relativity provides no microstates. Black holes are just smooth features in spacetime, they don't seem to have a large amount of scrambled information being squished and squashed in the motion of a lot of tiny subcomponents like the molecules in a substance.</p>
<p>That's ugly but not a deal-breaker. Information is not conserved, what's the big deal? It actually is not really that big of a deal classically.</p>
<p>But we are fearless and we venture into the quantum regime.</p>
<p>Information loss is a serious problem in quantum mechanics. This is roughly because, in the normal quantum mechanics we know and love, time evolution is implemented by a unitary transformation, the complex equivalent of a rotation in the space of states. As we have seen, the destruction of information comes always with an impossibility to evolve unambiguously our state backwards in time and vice versa. However unitary transformations are always invertible, so this is simply not contemplatable. And more or less this is why information loss is called non-unitarity, and why it is incompatible with standard quantum mechanics (which is then called "unitary").</p>
<p>Thankfully, introducing quantum mechanics in the context of black holes does not simply produce the above fundamental problem, but also the germ of a solution. Black holes are not black and emit thermalized radiation at a temperature</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img style="display:inline;" title=" T = \frac{\hbar}{8\pi GM} " src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gif.latex? T = \frac{\hbar}{8\pi GM}" alt="[; T = \frac{\hbar}{8\pi GM} ;]" /></p>
<p>which is the famous discovery of Hawking (see <a href="https://hologrammata.wordpress.com/2016/09/07/a-geometric-proof-of-hawking-radiation-through-imaginary-time/">here</a> for a non-conventional derivation). This is huge - it means first of all black holes evaporate, shedding their mass by emitting radiation out towards infinity, and are thus not eternal. But most importantly, it tells us black hole are thermodynamic, macroscopic systems. They also have an entropy; you can calculate it by noting that the energy of the black hole is its mass and the first law of thermodynamics, it comes out to be<img class="alignnone aligncenter" style="display:inline;" title=" S = \frac{A}{4G\hbar} " src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gif.latex? S = \frac{A}{4G\hbar}" alt="[; S = \frac{A}{4G\hbar} ;]" />aka "one-quarter the area of the horizon in units of Planck areas". In case this is not immediately evident, this is a huge entropy. At least, huge for the space it is crammed in; in fact it is the largest possible entropy in a given volume. Entropy is a measure of the number of possible microstates (in fact, it is essentially the logarithm of the number of microstates); then... where the hell are these microstates? That is one big leap: first black holes have the minimum number of microstates, now they have the maximum possible. The point should be that this big reservoir of information only exists at the quantum gravity level, encoded in degrees of freedom that we are currently too young to understand and that general relativity misses completely.I am not going to argue what these degrees of freedom are. I'm just going to try to give a convincing argument for an answer for <em>where</em> this information is stored and how that is usually worked into plausible solutions to the black hole information loss paradox.</p>
