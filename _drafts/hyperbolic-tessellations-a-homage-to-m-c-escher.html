<p>M. C. Escher is easily my favourite artist of all time.</p>
<p>While I have always been fascinated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Escher's greatest achievement is also the most underrated: recognizing the aesthetic value of the planarian.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_656" align="aligncenter" width="1281"]<img class="size-full wp-image-656 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/flat-worms.jpg" alt="flat-worms" width="1281" height="1050" /> make way for best animal. "Flat Worms", 1959.[/caption]</p>
<p>Maurits Cornelis also spent a sizeable chunk of his life in rural Italy. It shows:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_663" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<img class="size-full wp-image-663 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/02-castrovalva-1930.jpg" alt="02-castrovalva-1930" width="1280" height="1609" /> "Castrovalva", 1930. Castrovalva is a minuscule town (~ 30 people) in the Abruzzo region.[/caption]</p>
<p>But Escher is also famous for his tessellations. The regular subdivision of the plane in interlocking units is given an original spin as Maurits Cornelis uses various animals (birds, reptiles, fishes) and other organic forms as tiles, in a unique blend of naturalistic and technical drawing.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_687" align="aligncenter" width="927"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-687 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lizard-1.jpg" alt="lizard-1" width="927" height="1000" /> "Lizard", 1942[/caption]</p>
<p>The power of tessellations is that they make the shape of space visible. It's not much different to how we use grids and similar devices to depict some information about lengths and angles - what Escher does is the same... but with his own personal blend of geometric and organic imagery. He is well aware that the human mind is unable to picture a "homogeneous" infinity: tilings introduce a rhythm, a repeating pattern droning along space, and guides the eye dancing all the way to the infinitely-far.</p>
<p>He likes the idea of mapping an infinitely long or wide space in a finite region that can be depicted. So he draws tessellations of the Euclidean plane, transformed under such maps.<br />
He has a particular predilection for <i>conformal</i>Â maps, those that preserve angles and thus the shape of sufficiently small objects. The mathematician (and theoretical physicist) are aware of the implications, primarily because in two dimensions, conformal = holomorphic. But he probably doesn't, he just likes that things look as undeformed as possible. Shape &gt; size.</p>
<p>It's probably in this reasoning that works like "Development III" are based in. Escher has taken a tessellation of the Euclidean plane with interlocking lizards, and has mapped it to the plane minus the origin through a conformal transformation. In this case the transformation is not injective: you can see the black lizards make circles while they would make straight lines in the original Euclidean tiling. I'm guessing the map is something like $latex e^z$ in the complex plane, with the period of the tiling matched so an integer number of lizards run around each circle. I haven't checked whether this is exact, it probably isn't.</p>
<p>Also note, there are a few lizards on the sides that don't fit the pattern, I think they're just there to close the pattern and have it pleasingly contained in a square. That's a problem Escher most definitely was interested in solving: he couldn't manage to map <em>everything</em> to a finite region. In "Smaller and Smaller", one side of the tiling does get smaller and smaller, but another gets bigger and bigger, and it shoots off to infinity (paper infinity!), and Escher does not seem to like that, and tries to draw around that.</p>

This drawing is constructed by conformally transforming a Euclidean tessellation.[/caption]</p>
<p>Who can blame him? There's something incredibly satisfying about geometric designs being contained in a simple shape.</p>
<p>But we know (I don't think he did) that this cannot be done, that is you cannot map the plane conformally to a compact region. Not even by allowing n-to-1 maps like the above. (This follows very easily from Liouville's theorem). So that seemed to be it.</p>
