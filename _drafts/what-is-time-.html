<p>So... what is time?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is a deceivingly simple question. However, it's doubly deceiving, because it's actually simple. The answer is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Time is what you measure with a clock.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Yeah, sure, Einstein. And a clock is a thing that measures time. No, that last one is a joke. Clocks are things like swatches, wall clocks, atomic clocks, whatever. You choose anyone you like, I pointÂ  at it and tell you "definition: that's a clock. And also, every other instrument that used alongside that thing in the same way gives the same measurements is also a clock."</p>
<p>There's no escaping this: you cannot define a truly physical concept without grounding your construction on a real world, physical occurrence. I know this feels uneasy - you should or at least feel you should be able to grasp and encompass "time" through pure reason. You should be capable of reconstructing "time" in your mind independently of the physical world.</p>
<p>A clock is started at a specific event A. Events are points in spacetime, but we don't know yet about that. So let's just say: things happen at events. I'd argue it's obvious to define when two things happen at the same event: they are together, and simultaneous. You can definitely ensure two things happening at the same place are simultaneous without using a clock, right?</p>
<p>So a clock is started at an event A, is kept running and then it's stopped at event B. We call the number on the display <em>the clock's</em> proper time between A and B.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">
Demystifying the twin paradox.</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">
Two twins start their clock together at event A. Then one twin stays home while the other travels around the Universe at high speed. Then they meet again on Earth at event B and stop their clocks. It turns out (at least in relativity) they have aged differently - more precisely, the clocks show different numbers.</p>
<p>How can this be? Simple: they're measuring different things. Therefore, there is no reason for the measured values to be equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A time measurement between events A and B is not simply a measure associated with the pair of events, it depends (could depend) on the "path in spacetime" of the clock between them, namely the curve of events it passes through (hence why we called it <em>a specific clock's</em> proper time between A and B). Different clock, different paths, a priori different durations. Instead, two clocks that follow the same path in spacetime are always together, and together clocks work the same (by definition of clock), and so they will measure the same value.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now, this doesn't prove the two measurements are different, nor which one is bigger and why, and what are the values, but each of those things will depend on what specific model of spacetime you will apply (special relavity, de Sitter relativity, Newtonian mechanics, whatever). The above instead is completely general and unquestionable, because it's just playing with the definition. It shows most importantly</p>
