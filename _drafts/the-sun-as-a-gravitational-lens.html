<p>You can use the Sun as the lens in the biggest and most powerful telescope you could ever imagine. As in, it's conceivable.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the same as an actual lens though. Convex lenses make parallel rays converge to a single point, the focal point; to do so they must deflect rays more distant from the axis of the lens (the distance is the "impact parameter" b) more than those closer.</p>
<p>We know from Einstein's generous contribution that light rays get deflected when passing in an object's gravitational field, by an angle</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex \delta \phi = \frac{4GM}{c^2 b}&amp;s=2$</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and the angle actually increases with decreasing b, contrary to how a lens would function. So surely a gravitational lens cannot deflect <em>all</em> incoming parallel light rays from a distant source into a single focal point. It has no concept of focal length, and will never produce a "clear" magnified image.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>But</strong> it will still make all rays with the same impact parameter b converge to a single point a certain distance away. This is how Einstein rings happen. When we are at that specific point away from the gravitational lens, and there is a source of light directly opposite, we receive all parallel rays impacting the lens with impact parameter b and we see an image of the source distorted into a ring of light around the lens.</p>

An alignment so good as to produce an actual ring such as this is pretty rare.[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We have many images of Einstein rings (or to be precise almost always just gravitational mirages, which are the "irregular" version of rings). We also have extensive measurements on the bending of light by the Sun's gravity (for example, Shapiro delay). Then, why can't you find pictures of Einstein rings formed by Sun on Google images?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I know what you're thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Uh, actually, the Sun isn't massive enough. Galaxies are immensely more massive than the Sun, so their massive gravitational fields can bend light enough to make Einstein rings. The Sun just cannot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">and nope, that is not true.  latex \delta \phi &amp;s=1$ doesn't just depend on the mass. The largest deflection angle (without actually having the ray pass <em>through</em> the object) it's when the ray grazes the surface of the lensing object, actual or approximate, so that b is roughly the radius R of the lens. This is</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex \delta \phi_\text{max} = \frac{4GM}{c^2 R} &amp;s=2$</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now who has the bigger $latex \frac{GM}{c^2 R} &amp;s=1$ ratio, the Sun or a galaxy? (Note this ratio is a measure of the "general relativitiness" of the object). The Sun has it of order $latex 10^{-6} &amp;s=1$, the Milky Way something between $latex 10^{-6} &amp;s=1$ and $latex 10^{-7} &amp;s=1$ mostly depending on how you want to implement the approximation of the galaxy as spherically symmetric. The Milky Way and galaxies in general are heavy but also very large. So it's more or less the same, if anything the Sun is slightly better at this lensing business.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> So where are the Sun's Einstein rings? The point is... we're too close. The maximum deflection as of the equation above turns out to be, more precisely</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex \delta \phi = 8.5 \cdot 10^{-6} &amp;s=2$</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">so that the distance at which the deflected rays converge is $latex R_\text{Sun} / \delta \phi \sim 540 \text{AU}&amp;s=1$. We have an unimaginably powerful telescope on our hands, but we're too close to the lens and too far from the eyepiece.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ok, can we send spacecraft that far? Half a thousand astronomical units is a lot. Pluto is some 40 AU away. Voyager 1, the Farthest in the Galaxy, is 135 AU away as of today. Then... maybe?</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">The FOCAL spacecraft</h2>
<p>While I don't think he was the first to introduce the concept, Prof. Claudio Maccone has probably spent more energy than anyone else on this sad planet to popularize it.</p>
<p>The FOCAL mission, which he first presented to the ESA in 1993 and then proceeded to detail in conferences and papers (and a book), consists essentially in gluing</p>
