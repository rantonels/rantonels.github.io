Why not? In this paper

[**AdS Vacuum Bubbles, Holography and dual RG Flows**, Riccardo Antonelli, Ivano Basile (Pisa, Scuola Normale Superiore), Alessandro Bombini (INFN, Padua & Padua U.). Jun 6, 2018. 26 pp., arXiv:1806.02289 \[hep-th\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02289)

we've argued for this particular viewpoint.

Holography, or AdS/CFT specifically, is a strange and counterintuitive story, and most of it I think boils down to anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime being profoundly weird. To picture life in AdS, imagine living in hyperbolic space, such as the one depicted in the Poincar√© disk below:

{% include image.html name="hept.jpg" caption="I would have just shown Escher's *Circle limit III* if it wasn't for those meddling copyright laws. I made this picture, do what you want with it." %}

As you might know, while the boundary of hyperbolic space might be depicted at a finite distance from the centre, this is an illusion and the boundary is infinitely far away in terms of distances measured by a hyperbolic inhabitant. Hyperbolic space is infinite much like the normal Euclidean plane.

But AdS adds a twist, involving the time dimension too in the hyperbolic situation. There is a time dilation between you at the centre and someone far away, and the sign of this time dilation is where the magic lies. 

Imagine standing at the center of the disk, and sending your friend to walk to the boundary at a constant speed. He, of course, walks and walks forever, as the distance is simply infinite, and he never sees the boundary get any closer.

But to you, things are a bit different. Because of the time dilation, you actually see your friend speed up the farther he is from you. In fact, you see him go faster and faster and live longer and longer stretches of his infinite life of straight travel to the boundary. In fact, in a finite time (measured by you) he actually *reaches* the boundary. Of course, he's lived infinite years then, but that's no big deal. He might decide to come back to you. So he does the same trip in reverse, slowing down, and reaches you in the same amount of finite time.

He can now tell you all about the boundary at infinity, and you had to wait for a relatively small time for this information.

This fact is deeply troubling, but it is a nearly unescapable consequence of the negative curvature of AdS, corresponding to its negative cosmological constant. It means essentially that the boundary of AdS, even though it is ``at infinity'', should be ascribed at least *some* physicality, as it is able to interact with the bulk (the name for the AdS).

This isn't how the story of AdS/CFT went, but one could argue that a posteriori that this peculiarity is an essential ingredient, maybe the whole point of the correspondence. The boundary can receive and send gravitational waves, so in some sense there is a dependence of physics in the bulk from *conditions on the boundary*, or... **boundary conditions**. 

The AdS/CFT correspondence states that there is a different theory, the infamous CFT, that lives on the boundary (so in one dimension less) and is related to the bulk in this weird way: the way the bulk reacts to boundary perturbations is mapped to the physics of the corresponding perturbation in the CFT. This constitutes the holographic dictionary, and the bulk and boundary are interpreted as translations of the same physics in different language.
