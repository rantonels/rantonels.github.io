As any big, fat, intimidating classical electrodynamics manual can tell you, an accelerated charge emits radiation. The power lost to radiation is proportional to the acceleration squared according to the Larmor formula:

$$ P = \frac{q^2 a^2}{6\pi \epsilon_0 c^3} $$

Now, we're here on Earth, I have a charge in my hand. I let go of it. What happens? It should start falling down, accelerating at $$ 1g $$. But if it does... it should emit radiation.

That is problematic, because it constitutes a violation of Einstein's principle of equivalence. If our falling charge is accompained by an uncharged partner, the two particles are going to drift as the charged one loses energy to radiation. By falling at different rates, the particles mark to an observer falling alongside them that they are indeed falling in a gravitational field and not simply drifting in deep space away from any mass. That these situations are distinguishable by the falling observer (FO) using only local measurements is the equivalence principle, the wonderful idea at the heart of General Relativity.

This one is a **real** head-scratcher. It's not ok to call this a *puzzle* because it's not really about being clever; it is a genuine problem, one of those that has more to say to you than what you have to throw at it to solve it. Abyss that stares back and all that.

The equivalence principle would suggest \
