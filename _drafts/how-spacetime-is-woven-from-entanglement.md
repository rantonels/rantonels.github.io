It builds upon holography, this strange family of equivalences between gravity in $$D$$-dimensional spacetime and quantum field theories in $$D-1$$-dimensions. And the most studied and fascinating subclass is certainly given by the AdS/CFT correspondences. Anti-de Sitter spacetime is a remarkable object, the spacetime equivalent of a hyperbolic space. It turns out that hyperbolic geometry plays a key role in this puzzling business, and it is precisely its unusual features that make it work so good in the holographic dictionary. The simplest case of hyperbolic space (not in [this way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_hyperbolic_manifold), I mean in [this way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry)) is all that we need to discuss the matter, and it is of course given by the hyperbolic plane, depicted below with a very reasonable accuracy, given that it's impossible to do exactly:

It is impossible to draw the hyperbolic plane faithfully (that is, isometrically) because it's negatively curved, and the Euclidean plane is flat. What's less obvious is that unlike the positively-curved sphere, the hyperbolic plane cannot even be realized isometrically as a surface in Euclidean *space*. You are invited to try, however, especially with a material which is not perfectly rigid, and your would-be hyperbolic surface is going to try its best and will curl up into intricate frills like the the back of this little guy here:

These remarkable creatures are kleptoplastic: they steal chloroplasts from the algae they eat and continue photosynthesis.' %}

An astounding variety of living creatures realize these near-hyperbolic structures actually (the most obvious example being actual lettuce) though the effect can be replicated artificially through [crochet](http://crochetcoralreef.org/about/hyperbolic_space.php), [sewing](http://www.geometrygames.org/HyperbolicBlanket/index.html.en) or in a computer, like I did in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9WZqL8zCSI) a while ago. Hyperbolic planes crammed into Euclidean space writhe and fold in this manner because they have too much space in too little... space.

Basically, the circumference of a hyperbolic circle grows very fast with the radius. If I am on a hyperbolic plane with curvature radius one metre, and I want to enclose a circular region of radius 10 metres, I need roughly **70 km** of fence. And the area is equally big. That is key if you want to have a huge area with small distances between points, a property useful for living beings which need to do things on surfaces... like lettuce. 

Another very much related fact is that it is very easy to get lost. If you and your friend are standing close to eachother and start walking parallel, you will quickly diverge. (Compare with the plane where you keep the same distance and the sphere where you converge).
