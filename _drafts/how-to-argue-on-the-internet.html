<h3>He simplified technical concept X as approachable concept Y. But Y is wrong and imprecise! He should have just said X!</h3>
<p>Ok, here's the deal: you can't judge explanation Y by comparing it to the original correct notion X. It's not fair. Example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Him: Well, in a certain sense, vectors are a bit like arrows.</p>
<p>You: Wrong. Vectors are in general elements of a vector space, which is a set with a binary operation...</p></blockquote>
<p>see the problem? Exactly zero percent of the people involved benefit from your comment. Him, along with any other expert, knows exactly what you mean, which is X, which is what they had in mind when they tried to simplify it into Y. Non-experts look at his comment and see something approachable, they look at yours and understand nothing.</p>
<p>What you can do is imagine yourself in his position. You know X, good. Try to explain X in simple terms, roughly as simple as Y, but give it your own spin, in your head. So you have explanation Z, which should not be harder to understand than Y. Now, compare Y and Z. Is Y <em>really</em> that much worse than Z? Does it completely suck? If you're not completely sure that Z is much, much better than Y, keep it to yourself.</p>
<p>It's really easy to judge a popular explanation by reading it "from above". You might underestimate the work that went into that synthesis.</p>
<h3>But the explanation Y he gave of X is really incorrect and misleading.</h3>
<p>Yeah, in this case, criticize. Some explanations are oversimplified, granted, but some are flat out dumb. You can tell because you know X, then you read Y, and now you know a little less X and feel a little more stupid. Example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vectors are like flowers. They have a series of petals, but no two flowers will be identical. If you pluck a petal, you also need to pluck the opposite petals so the number of petals is always even.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just remember to be polite. By the way, you don't need to speak in simple terms. A person providing an incorrect explanation Y of technical concept X should be required to defend themselves when challenged on X on a technical level.</p>
<h3>Aha! He committed the X fallacy! You, good sir, are guilty of the X fallacy.</h3>
<p>Don't do this. Ever. <b>Nobody </b>likes this.<br />
If you think someone has argued using a faulty logical argument, <b>gently </b>point out <i>explicitly</i> why you think the point does not exactly follow from the premise. Do not refer to a tabulated anthology of classified mistakes and absolutely do not use the f-word. You're not Thomas of Aquinas, you're going to look like an absolute douche.</p>
<p><strong>No exceptions.</strong></p>
